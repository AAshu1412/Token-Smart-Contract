# Solidity Token Contract::

This repository contains a Solidity contract for a basic token implementation. The contract allows minting and burning tokens, and provides public access to token-related information.

Contract Details::
The contract, named MyToken, is implemented in Solidity version 0.8.10. It includes the following functionality:

Public Variables::
tokenName:    A public string variable representing the name of the token. In this contract, the token name is set to "ZETO".
tokenAbbrv:   A public string variable representing the abbreviation of the token. Here, the token abbreviation is set to "ZET".
totalSupply:  A public uint variable representing the total supply of the token. The initial value is set to 0.

Mapping Variable::
balance: A mapping variable that maps addresses to their corresponding token balances. It stores the balance of each address in the contract.

Mint Function::
The mint function allows the creation of new tokens. It takes two parameters: _address, which represents the address to which the new tokens will be minted, and value, which specifies the amount of tokens to mint. This function increases the total supply of tokens and updates the balance of the specified address accordingly.

Burn Function::
The burn function allows the destruction of existing tokens. It takes two parameters: _address, which represents the address from which tokens will be burned, and value, which specifies the amount of tokens to burn. This function requires that the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the specified value. If the condition is met, it decreases the total supply of tokens and updates the balance of the address accordingly.

Usage::
To use this contract, you can deploy it to a supported Ethereum development network or blockchain. You can interact with the contract by calling its functions, such as mint and burn, to manage the token supply and balances.
